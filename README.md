## What is AnnLite?

`AnnLite` is a lightweight library for **fast** and **filterable** *approximate nearest neighbor search* (ANNS).
It allows to search for nearest neighbors in a dataset of millions of points with a Pythonic API.


**Highlighted features:**

- üê• **Easy-to-use**: a simple API is designed to be used with Python. It is easy to use and intuitive to set up to production.

- üêé **Fast**: the library uses a highly optimized approximate nearest neighbor search algorithm (*HNSW*) to search for nearest neighbors.

- üîé **Filterable**: the library allows you to search for nearest neighbors within a subset of the dataset.

- üç± **Integration**: Smooth integration with neural search ecosystem including [Jina](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina) and [DocArray](https://github.com/jina-ai/docarray),
    so that users can easily expose search API with **gRPC** and/or **HTTP**.

The library is easy to install and use. It is designed to be used with Python.

## Installation

To use AnnLite, you need to first install it. The easiest way to install AnnLite is using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -U annlite
```

or install from source:

```bash
python setup.py install
```

## Quick start

Before you start, you need to know some experience about [DocArray](https://github.com/jina-ai/docarray).
`AnnLite` is designed to be used with [DocArray](https://github.com/jina-ai/docarray), so you need to know how to use `DocArray` first.

For example, you can create a `DocArray` with `1000` random vectors with `128` dimensions:

```python
from docarray import DocumentArray
import numpy as np

docs = DocumentArray.empty(1000)
docs.embeddings = np.random.random([1000, 128]).astype(np.float32)
```


### Index

Then you can create an `AnnIndexer` to index the created `docs` and search for nearest neighbors:

```python
from annlite import AnnLite

ann = AnnLite(128, metric='cosine', data_path="/tmp/annlite_data")
ann.index(docs)
```

Note that this will create a directory `/tmp/annlite_data` to persist the documents indexed.
If this directory already exists, the index will be loaded from the directory.
And if you want to create a new index, you can delete the directory first.

### Search

Then you can search for nearest neighbors for some query docs with `ann.search()`:

```python
query = DocumentArray.empty(5)
query.embeddings = np.random.random([5, 128]).astype(np.float32)

result = ann.search(query)
```

Then, you can inspect the retrieved docs for each query doc inside `query` matches:
```python
for q in query:
    print(f'Query {q.id}')
    for k, m in enumerate(q.matches):
        print(f'{k}: {m.id} {m.scores["cosine"]}')
```

```bash
Query ddbae2073416527bad66ff186543eff8
0: 47dcf7f3fdbe3f0b8d73b87d2a1b266f {'value': 0.17575037}
1: 7f2cbb8a6c2a3ec7be024b750964f317 {'value': 0.17735684}
2: 2e7eed87f45a87d3c65c306256566abb {'value': 0.17917466}
Query dda90782f6514ebe4be4705054f74452
0: 6616eecba99bd10d9581d0d5092d59ce {'value': 0.14570713}
1: d4e3147fc430de1a57c9883615c252c6 {'value': 0.15338594}
2: 5c7b8b969d4381f405b8f07bc68f8148 {'value': 0.15743542}
...
```

Or shorten the loop as one-liner using the element & attribute selector:

```python
print(query['@m', ('id', 'scores__cosine')])
```

### Update

After you have indexed the `docs`, you can update the docs in the index by calling `ann.update()`:

```python
updated_docs = docs.sample(10)
updated_docs.embeddings = np.random.random([10, 128]).astype(np.float32)

ann.update(updated_docs)
```


### Delete

And finally, you can delete the docs from the index by calling `ann.delete()`:

```python
to_delete = docs.sample(10)
ann.delete(to_delete)
```

## Search with filters

To support search with filters, the annlite must be created with `colums` parameter, which is a series of fields you want to filter by.
At the query time, the annlite will filter the dataset by providing `conditions` for certain fields.

```python
import annlite

# the column schema: (name:str, dtype:type, create_index: bool)
ann = annlite.AnnLite(128, columns=[('price', float)], data_path="/tmp/annlite_data")
```

Then you can insert the docs, in which each doc has a field `price` with a float value contained in the `tags`:


```python
import random

docs = DocumentArray.empty(1000)
docs = DocumentArray(
    [
        Document(id=f'{i}', tags={'price': random.random()})
        for i in range(1000)
    ]
)

docs.embeddings = np.random.random([1000, 128]).astype(np.float32)

ann.index(docs)
```

Then you can search for nearest neighbors with filtering conditions as:

```python
query = DocumentArray.empty(5)
query.embeddings = np.random.random([5, 128]).astype(np.float32)

ann.search(query, filter={"price": {"$lte": 50}}, limit=10)
print(f'the result with filtering:')
for i, q in enumerate(query):
    print(f'query [{i}]:')
    for m in q.matches:
        print(f'\t{m.id} {m.scores["euclidean"].value} (price={m.tags["x"]})')
```

The `conditions` parameter is a dictionary of conditions. The key is the field name, and the value is a dictionary of conditions.
The query language is the same as  [MongoDB Query Language](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/).
We currently support a subset of those selectors.

- `$eq` - Equal to (number, string)
- `$ne` - Not equal to (number, string)
- `$gt` - Greater than (number)
- `$gte` - Greater than or equal to (number)
- `$lt` - Less than (number)
- `$lte` - Less than or equal to (number)
- `$in` - Included in an array
- `$nin` - Not included in an array


The query will be performed on the field if the condition is satisfied. The following is an example of a query:

1. A Nike shoes with white color

    ```python
    {
      "brand": {"$eq": "Nike"},
      "category": {"$eq": "Shoes"},
      "color": {"$eq": "White"}
    }
    ```

    We also support boolean operators `$or` and `$and`:

    ```python
    {
      "$and":
        {
          "brand": {"$eq": "Nike"},
          "category": {"$eq": "Shoes"},
          "color": {"$eq": "White"}
        }
    }
    ```

2. A Nike shoes or price less than `100$`:

        ```python
        {
        "$or":
            {
            "brand": {"$eq": "Nike"},
            "price": {"$lte": 100}
            }
        }
        ```
