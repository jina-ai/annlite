# AnnLite


## What is AnnLite?

`AnnLite` is a lightweight library for **fast** and **memory efficient** *approximate nearest neighbor search* (ANNS).
It allows to search for nearest neighbors in a dataset of millions of points with a Pythonic API.

- üê• **Easy-to-use**: a simple API is designed to be used with Python. It is easy to use and intuitive to set up to production.
- üêé **Fast**: the library uses a highly optimized approximate nearest neighbor search algorithm. It allows you to
    search for nearest neighbors in a dataset of millions of points in a fraction of a second.
- üí° **Hybrid-search**: employ an efficient pre-filtering algorithm to support hybrid search. It supports filtering
    by distance and by attributes.
- üç± **Integration**: Smooth integration with neural search ecosystem including Jina and DocArray, so that users can easily
    expose search API with gRPC and/or HTTP.

## Installation

```bash
pip install annlite
```

or install from source:

```bash
python setup.py install
```

## Quick start

In this example, we will search for nearest neighbors in the dataset [Totally looks like]()

```python
import annlite
from docarray import DocArray

# Load the dataset

data = DocArray.load('data/dataset.json')

ann = annlite.AnnLite(dataset_path='data/dataset.csv')

# Index the dataset
ann.index(data)

# Search for nearest neighbors
ann.search(query_point=[1, 2, 3], k=3)
```

And to see the results, run the following command:

```bash
python -m annlite.cli --dataset_path data/dataset.csv --query_point [1, 2, 3] --k 3
```

We can also use the `--help` option to see the available options.

To support search with filters, the annlite must be created with `fields` parameter, which is a series of fields you want to filter by.
At the query time, the annlite will filter the dataset by providing `conditions` for certain fields.

```python
import annlite

ann = annlite.AnnLite(dataset_path='data/dataset.csv', fields=['city'])
ann.search(query_point=[1, 2, 3], k=3, conditions={'distance': {'$lt': 1}})
```

The `conditions` parameter is a dictionary of conditions. The key is the field name, and the value is a dictionary of conditions.
The query language is the same as MongoDB. The following is an example of a query:

```python
{
    'distance': {'$lt': 1},
    'city': {'$eq': 'Beijing'}
}
```
We also support boolean operators:

```python
{
    'city': {'$eq': 'Beijing'},
    '$or': [
        {'city': {'$eq': 'Beijing'}},
        {'city': {'$eq': 'Shanghai'}}
    ]
}
```
For more information, please refer to [MongoDB Query Language](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/).


The query will be performed on the field if the condition is satisfied.
