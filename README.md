# PQLite

`PQLite` is a blaze fast **Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search** (ANNS) library.

## WARNING

- `PQLite` is still in the very early stages of development. APIs can and will change (now is the time to make suggestions!). Important features are missing. Documentation is sparse.
- `PQLite` contains code that must be compiled to be used. The build is prepared in `setup.py`, users only need to `pip install .` from the root directory.

## About

- **Features**: A quick overview of PQlite's features.
- **Roadmap**: The PQLite team's development plan.
- **Introducing PQLite**: A blog post covering some of PQLite's features

## Quick Start

### Setup

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jina-ai/pqlite.git \
  && cd pqlite \
  && pip install .
```
## How to use?

1. Create a new `pqlite`

```python
import random
import numpy as np
from pqlite import PQLite

N = 10000 # number of data points
Nt = 2000
Nq = 10
D = 128 # dimentionality / number of features

Xt = np.random.random((Nt, D)).astype(np.float32)  # 2,000 128-dim vectors for training

# the column schema: (name:str, dtype:type, create_index: bool)
pqlite = PQLite(d_vector=D, n_cells=64, n_subvectors=8, columns=[('x', float, True)])
pqlite.fit(Xt)
```

2. Add new data

```python
X = np.random.random((N, D)).astype(np.float32)  # 10,000 128-dim vectors to be indexed

tags = [{'x': random.random()} for _ in range(N)]
pqlite.add(X, ids=list(range(len(X))), doc_tags=tags)
```

3. Search with Filtering

```python
query = np.random.random((Nq, D)).astype(np.float32)  # a 128-dim query vector

# without filtering
dists, ids = pqlite.search(query, k=5)

print(f'the result without filtering:')
for i, (dist, idx) in enumerate(zip(dists, ids)):
    print(f'query [{i}]: {dist} {idx}')

# with filtering
# condition schema: (column_name: str, relation: str, value: any)
conditions = [('x', '<', 0.3)]
dists, ids = pqlite.search(query, conditions=conditions, k=5)

print(f'the result with filtering:')
for i, (dist, idx) in enumerate(zip(dists, ids)):
    print(f'query [{i}]: {dist} {idx}')
```
4. Update data

```python
Xn = np.random.random((10, D)).astype(np.float32)  # 10,000 128-dim vectors to be indexed

tags = [{'x': random.random()} for _ in range(10)]
pqlite.update(Xn, ids=list(range(len(Xn))), doc_tags=tags)
```

5. Delete data

```python
pqlite.delete(ids=['1', '2'])
```
